// 27. Remove Element

// Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
// Return k.

// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
// Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
// Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
// Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

func removeElement(_ nums: inout [Int], _ val: Int) -> Int {
    var slow = 0
    var fast = 0

    while fast < nums.count {
        if nums[fast] != val {
            nums[slow] = nums[fast]
            slow += 1
        }
        fast += 1
    }

    return slow
}

// test
var nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]
let res = removeElement(&nums, 3)
print(res) // Output: 2
print(nums.prefix(res)) // Output: [2, 2]
